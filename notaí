Má ceapann tú nach bhuil daoine i do gchoinne a chara, éist leis an salachar seo:

Because languages are intrinsically valuable. You may have a definition for what Irishness is, and it probably has something to do with Soccer and geography; but there is another definition and it has to do with being Gaelic, and yeah it got hammered but guess what, it's still alive. And in many regards it's thriving.

no no no.

Darr liom is meoin é an Gaelachas
pointe a haon:
pointe a dó:
pointe a trí:

Más meoin é, is rogha é.

Freagra an cheist mar sin: 
Is Gael muid nuair is Gael muid.
